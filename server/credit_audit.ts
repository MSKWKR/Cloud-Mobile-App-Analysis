// server/credit_audit.ts — daily credit reconciliation ("did anyone mint credits?").
//
// Balances live in Firestore (users/{uid}.credits) as a bare number, so anything
// able to write that document — a leaked service account, a bug, an exploited
// endpoint — can hand itself credits with no trace. This module gives that number
// something to be checked against:
//
//   1. credit_ledger    — append-only journal in SQLite, written by every code path
//                         that legitimately changes a balance (signup, purchase,
//                         consume, admin adjustment, correction).
//   2. credit_snapshots — every user's balance, once a day, at a fixed time.
//   3. runCreditAudit() — for each user: yesterday's snapshot + today's ledger
//                         entries must equal today's balance. Anything else is an
//                         anomaly, recorded in credit_anomalies and alerted on.
//
// The ledger alone is not enough: a grant could be journaled and still be bogus.
// So every `purchase` entry is additionally matched against a `paid` row in
// newebpay_orders — i.e. money NewebPay actually confirmed — and every `signup`
// entry against the one-per-user seed. A hacker who both raises the Firestore
// balance *and* forges a ledger row still fails the payment-backing check.
//
// Two checks exist because a day-over-day comparison alone has blind spots:
//   • paid orders are matched in both directions, so a payment that was charged
//     and never credited (drift of exactly zero) is found as well as one that was
//     credited and never journaled;
//   • each entry's recorded balanceAfter is checked against the range the day's
//     deltas allow, so a balance that was raised, spent down and put back before
//     the next snapshot still leaves a trace.
//
// Nothing here writes to Firestore unless CREDIT_AUDIT_AUTO_CLAMP is on, and even
// then it only ever removes unexplained credits — it never grants.
